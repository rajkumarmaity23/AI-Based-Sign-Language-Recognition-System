# AI-based Sign Language Recognition System

Welcome to our AI-based Sign Language Recognition System project! We're thrilled to introduce a solution aimed at breaking communication barriers for the deaf and mute community, fostering inclusivity across various domains like education, healthcare, and employment. With approximately 466 million people worldwide facing the muteness challenges, our project leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence to support and empower individuals in need.

## Project Highlights

### Key Features

1. **Real-time Interpretation:** Our AI model interprets sign language gestures in real-time, speaking out the corresponding words or numbers pointed by the user.
   
2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The application's frontend is intuitively designed, featuring reference images for easy interaction. This simplicity ensures seamless communication between users and the AI system.

3. **Consecutive Word Display:** The interpreted words are displayed consecutively, enhancing the fluidity of communication and understanding.

### How It Works

1. **Hand Gestures Recognition:** The system recognizes predetermined hand gestures corresponding to alphabets and digits.

2. **Real-time Audio Output:** Once the gestures are recognized, the AI system instantly vocalizes the corresponding words or numbers.

## Why It Matters

In India alone, 63 million people, including 53 lakh children, experience either complete or partial deafness. Additionally, 70 million individuals rely on sign language for communication. Our project addresses this substantial gap, promoting social interactions and independent living for those with hearing and speaking challenges.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rajkumarmaity23/Ai-Based-Sign-Language-Recognition-System.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd Ai-Based-Sign-Language-Recognition-System
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
